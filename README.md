# SECURE_Solutions
This project was a submission in the 2023 UChicago Techteam Ideathon, where it took first prize.

Description:
SECURE Telehealth Solutions is a web application designed to facilitate pro-bono medical consultations between doctors in Chicago, IL, and recipients of SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. The platform aims to bridge the gap between medical professionals and underserved communities by leveraging telehealth technology and connecting them through a digital marketplace.

Purpose:
The primary goal of SECURE Telehealth Solutions is to provide individuals with access to telehealth services, enabling them to receive medical consultations from qualified physicians without the need for physical appointments. By connecting doctors willing to volunteer their services with patients in need, the platform aims to improve healthcare access and outcomes for underserved populations, particularly those relying on SNAP benefits.
